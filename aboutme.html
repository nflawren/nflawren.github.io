                Hello! My name is Nicole Lawrence. I'm currently a full-time software engineer at The Walt Disney Company
                and a part-time graduate student at Boston University. I completed my Bachelor of Science at the University
                of Vermont, studying Computer Science in May 2021. I then moved to the Buffalo, NY area for my first job
                working as a software developer at M&T Bank. Then in mid-2022 I moved to the Bristol, CT area for my
                current position as a software engineer for The Walt Disney Company, where I work on
                <a href="https://www.espn.com">ESPN.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am originally from Jericho, VT, which is right outside of Burlington, VT. As a Vermont native, I love
                nature and being outside. Vermont has some beautiful state parks, and the lack of billboards really
                makes a difference in the everyday beauty! One of my favorite places is Lake Groton, VT, some of my
                favorite family vacations as a kid were trips there.
            </p>
